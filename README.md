# FitSync: Workout Tracking, Log and Reflection Journal

## Project Abstract
This project is a fitness tracker application where you can log workouts like lifting, running, sports, etc. There will be a calendar feature where you're able to schedule these workouts on a calendar and have reminders and check-ins for the workout and a review feature after workouts where you can log the workout and fill out what you did based on what type it was, for example, for weight training you can log the exercises with the sets, reps and weight and for a run you can log the mileage and pace, and reflect on how the workout was you can also schedule rest days. The app will also have a consistency score to show you how consistent you have been with your workouts, and a tab to show you your progress over tim,e using graphs to see if your performance is improving or declining based on prior workouts

## Scheduling & Calendar
Create, edit, and delete workouts and rest days on an in-app calendar.
Recurring templates (e.g., “Push Day,” “5K Tempo,” “Basketball scrimmage”).
Reminders and day-of check-ins (configurable lead time).

## Workout Logging
Lift: per-exercise entries with sets, reps, weight; auto-calc volume and estimated 1RM.
Run: distance, time, pace; an optional extension would be to add a GPS summary import.

Post-workout reflection: mood, effort, custom tags.

## Consistency & Progress
Consistency Score: ratio of completed vs. planned sessions, streaks, and adherence by type.
Progress Analytics: weekly volume (lift total kg, run miles), PRs, pace trends, time-in-zone.

## Notifications
Pre-workout reminder, missed-workout nudge, weekly planning prompt.
